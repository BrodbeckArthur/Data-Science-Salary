## Data Science Salaries 2025: A Tourist's Perspective in Toronto 
## * Why this project?
Currently, I am in Toronto, exploring the city as a tourist and absorbing the energy of one of North America's biggest tech hubs. Beyond visiting iconic spots like the CN Tower, I decided to use my transition into the tech field to investigate the real dynamics of the 2025 data market.

This project isn't just a coding exercise; it’s the result of my curiosity to see if the innovation "vibe" I feel on the streets of Toronto translates into real numbers and career opportunities. I wanted to understand how the Canadian market stands against global giants like the US and Europe while experiencing the local cost of living firsthand.

## * Challenges & The "Old Mac" Hack
One of the main challenges of this analysis was my hardware. I’m running a 2014 MacBook with macOS Big Sur. Instead of letting the hardware limit me, I used Google Colab to handle the processing in the cloud. This experience taught me that in data science, resourcefulness is just as important as coding—knowing how to use cloud solutions to bypass local limitations is a vital skill.

## * What I set out to discover
Toronto's Reality: How competitive is the Canadian market compared to the US and Europe?

The Career Ladder: What is the actual salary gap between Junior (Entry-level) and Senior roles?

Remote Work: In a city as expensive as Toronto, does working 100% remotely pay off?

Market Evolution: Did entry-level salaries actually grow from 2024 to 2025?

## * Key Findings from my "Research Trip"
Toronto holds its ground: The analysis confirmed that Canada remains a highly competitive location for data talent.

The Senior Jump: I noticed a significant salary spike for Senior roles, suggesting that while entry is competitive, the market heavily rewards experience and retention.

Remote Flexibility: 100% remote roles are paying as well as (or sometimes better than) on-site positions, which is a game-changer for someone living in a high-cost urban center.

## * Business Recommendations
Based on the data and my local observations, I’ve outlined three strategic insights for companies in high-cost hubs:

Expand Recruitment: Startups should look for Junior talent in a Remote-First model to tap into talent across Canada without Toronto's overhead costs.

Retention focus: To avoid "brain drain," firms need structured progression plans to bridge the gap between Mid-level and Senior salaries.

Smart Scaling: For Canadian firms expanding south, the data confirms a 20-30% salary premium in the US, making Canada the ideal hub for core Engineering and Data teams.
